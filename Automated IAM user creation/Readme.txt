In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as Cloud Specialist with the mission to migrate users in an automated way and manage AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) resources.

   There were 100 users that needed to be migrated and have MFA (Multi-factor authentication) enabled on their accounts, as this is a security best practice.

   To avoid repetitive and manual tasks in the AWS console, I needed to think about automating the processes. Used scripting to deploy multiple users using the information in a csv file.

  Also enforced MFA policy for all users for every user to change password when sign in for first time and enabled virtual MFA to test.
